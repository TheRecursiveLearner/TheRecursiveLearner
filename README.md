## *PC Technician*, *IT Support*, *Network Engineer*, *Cybersecurity Professional*

Hello, I'm Ameer. I began my career as a PC technician and swiftly climbed the ranks to lead operations in South America. Upon my move to the United States, I pivoted into cable installation, quickly advancing from entry-level to senior positions. Embracing the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, I took the initiative to self-study for Cisco CCNA certification, which propelled me into the role of a Network Engineer at an MSP. During this time, I also studied for CompTIA A+ and Microsoft Azure 900, further expanding my technical expertise.

As a Network Engineer, I specialized in crafting and maintaining robust wired and wireless networks. I thrived in troubleshooting intricate network issues and implementing innovative solutions like load balancing and Fail-Over WANs to optimize performance. I also taught myself Firewall technology, specifically Fortinet, acquiring affordable equipment on eBay to create a safe lab environment where I quickly became proficient.

In addition to my networking prowess, I tackled a broad spectrum of IT support challenges across diverse platforms such as Microsoft, VMware, Cisco, Fortinet, Active Directory, Hyper-V, backups, and ticketing systems.


## Objective
Developing a keen interest in cybersecurity during my tenure as a Network Engineer, I witnessed firsthand the direct impacts of cyber attacks. Motivated by this experience, I pursued self-study and achieved CompTIA Security+ certification.

My journey into cybersecurity continues as a SOC analyst, currently immersed in an internship at Cybernow Labs. I'm passionate about leveraging cutting-edge cybersecurity tools including email security, EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response), Vulnerability Scanning and Management, and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) to safeguard digital infrastructures.
